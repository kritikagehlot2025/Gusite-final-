        <p className="drop-cap">
          I was born in a city that does not sleep lightly. Rajasthan, India — sandstone
          and spice and a sky so wide it made ambition feel obligatory. My earliest memories
          are not of a classroom but of the space between things: between words in a
          conversation I was too young to join, between the notes of a raag my grandmother
          hummed while she cooked, between the lines of a physics problem my father was
          trying to explain to someone else and I was absorbing from across the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          That space between things is where I have always lived. Not quite inside any
          single discipline, any single culture, any single language. The gap, it turns
          out, is not emptiness. It is where everything interesting happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          My family moved when I was young — first within India, then out of it entirely,
          to Canada, to Montréal, a city whose own identity is built on the productive
          tension between languages and traditions. I did not know it then, but I was
          training for that city my whole life.

          Moving between countries at a formative age is not a neutral event. It rewires
          something. You stop assuming that the way things are done where you grew up is the
          only way — or even the best way. You develop a kind of permeability to context,
          an ability to read rooms that are not yours and find your footing faster than you
          should.
        </p>
        <p>
          I speak four languages: English, French, Hindi, and Marwari. Each one carries a
          different register of myself. English is where I think most precisely. French
          navigates the city. Hindi is where old memories arrive in intact sentences.
          Marwari is where I belong without explanation — the language of family dinners,
          festivals, and stories that predate every version of me I have so far been.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it mean to be fluent in a culture? It is not just the language. It is
          the assumptions embedded in the grammar, the things people do not say because
          they do not have to. I grew up learning to find those load-bearing silences in
          more than one culture, more than one linguistic family. It made me a better
          thinker, a better writer, and a better scientist. The best researchers I have
          encountered are all translators of a kind — moving fluently between levels of
          abstraction, between formalism and intuition, between their discipline's
          vocabulary and the common tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am still becoming fluent in all the cultures I move through. I do not think
          that process ever finishes. But it has given me a tolerance for ambiguity
          I now recognise as one of the most practically useful things I own.

        <EssayPhoto src={atmosTelescope} alt="Telescope and night sky observation" caption="Observing — always observing" align="right" />
        <p>
          If you asked me to identify the central obsession of my intellectual life, I
          would not give you a subject. I would give you a posture. I am obsessed with
          the moment when something that appeared complicated becomes, in the right frame,
          simple. The moment when a pattern reveals itself under enough scrutiny. The
          moment when the equation you have been staring at for an hour suddenly speaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physics found me through my father, who treated it not as a subject but as a
          lens. Before I had a name for it, I was learning to see forces as conversations,
          energy as currency, time as a dimension rather than a river. The formal study
          came later, and it came hard — I will not pretend otherwise. The mathematical
          machinery of physics is not gentle. But I kept returning to it because of what
          it promised: a language precise enough to describe the universe without losing
          its strangeness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematics followed closely. I competed in math olympiads not because I was
          the fastest calculator in the room but because I loved the architecture of proofs.
          Chess gave me something similar: the pleasure of thinking several moves ahead,
          of holding a branching tree of possibilities in memory and choosing the path
          with the best expected value. The disciplines are different in almost every
          surface feature. The underlying skill is the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Computer science arrived as a natural extension. I came to programming not from
          wanting to build apps but from wanting to build things that think. I taught myself
          React and TypeScript. I learned Python. I built this site — not because I want to
          be a software engineer, but because I want to be someone who can build whatever
          needs to be built, in whatever medium is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current interests: quantum information, complex systems, the mathematics of
          emergence, and the uncomfortable zone where computation meets cognition.

        <p>
          The assumption that STEM and the arts are in competition is one I have never
          been able to take seriously, because it has never matched my experience. The
          creativity required to design an experiment and the creativity required to write
          a novel are not different in kind. They are different in material.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been training in Hindustani classical vocal for years. Riyaaz — daily
          practice — is non-negotiable. A raag is not a melody; it is a grammar. It
          specifies which notes are permitted, which are forbidden, which are emphasised,
          in which direction the phrases typically move, what emotional territory the raag
          inhabits. Within those constraints, improvisation is not just allowed but
          required. You must find something new to say inside a structure that has been
          explored for centuries. I find this an almost exact description of what good
          science asks of you as well.

          Writing is the other major strand. I am several volumes into a novel series —
          a world built over years, with its own internal history, its own geography, its
          own rules for how power and knowledge are distributed. Worldbuilding at that
          scale is a systems design problem. Every chapter I revise makes me a better
          thinker.

          Badminton, chess, table tennis, karate, abacus competitions — each sounds like a
          hobby until you look closely at the underlying skill being built. In every case,
          it is the same: accurate perception under time pressure, decision-making with
          incomplete information, recovery from error without losing composure.

        <p>
          This site is an artifact. I built it from scratch — React, TypeScript, Vite,
          Tailwind — not because I needed a portfolio but because I needed a structure
          that could hold the full picture. Most portfolios are curated highlights.
          This is a dossier: every claim has evidence, every skill has a receipt, every
          curiosity has a paper trail.

          The FRC robotics team taught me what it means to build under pressure with a
          team that is counting on you. Build season is twelve weeks of design, iteration,
          fabrication, and testing, ending in competition. It is also twelve weeks of
          learning to communicate across roles — between the software team and the
          mechanical team, between the strategic vision and the engineering constraints.

          Zionaxelle is a multimedia brand I designed from nothing — visual identity,
          content strategy, web presence, production pipeline. It exists because I wanted
          to know whether I could build something coherent and ship it. I can. I did.

          I do not have a five-year plan in the conventional sense. I have a model of what
          I want my work to look like: rigorous, interdisciplinary, evidence-based, and
          built at the intersection of STEM and creative practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I know: I want to do research that matters. I want to make things that work.
          I want to keep training as a vocalist because the practice of it makes everything
          else better. I want to finish the novel. I want to keep building tools and
          systems that allow me to think more clearly, move faster, and share work more
          honestly.

          I am fifteen years old. I have been working on these things for most of my
          conscious life. I am going to keep working on them.
